Help people stay safe from the coronavirus

An idea is a social network, that whoever has the disease, or had contact with someone who had the disease, release their google maps history to the public, and as people check according to the GPS history, they are already available from these same data, or if they have had someone with a disease there, so they can check if theyâ€™ve already been somewhere contaminated, or can go somewhere safe, or receive notifications if it happened somewhere contaminated.
